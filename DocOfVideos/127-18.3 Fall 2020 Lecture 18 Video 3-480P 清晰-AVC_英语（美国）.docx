the rest of this playlist is the standard lecture that i give about object-oriented programming starting from the very beginning so it will be just a little bit redundant with what professor farid just said however i think there are enough differences in how we tend to describe these things and motivate them that it's worth watching them both and the rest of this lecture will also cover all of the mechanics of how you build your own classes and methods and all of that but perhaps you haven't gotten enough of professor farid's description yet i totally understand it's great so if you look in the description of this video you'll find links to the rest of his object-oriented programming lecture it does rely on a few things that we haven't covered yet like how to draw on a screen and how to use a notebook to write python you can learn about that stuff just by following the rest of the links in the description which walk you through the very first week of professor fareed's graduate course 206a i've also added a link to that course website in case you want to find more videos that he's made there so you're welcome to go explore that stuff now or you can keep watching this playlist and hear the standard 61a introduction
