Iteration means repeating things. One way we can  repeat the same statement many many times is with   a while statement. Okay, so a while statement is  the compound statement that contains within its   body something that we want to execute multiple  times let me show you a demonstration I start up   Python and I'm going to set the names I and total  to both be 0 and what I'm going to do is I'm going   to add up the numbers 1 2 & 3 to get a total of  6 in the following way I'll say while it's the   case that I is less than 3 I will change I to  be 1 more than it was before and I will change   total to be whatever total was plus whatever I  is now in a flash we've actually done quite a   bit of computation now it's the case that I is  3 and total is 6 which is what you get when you   add 1 2 & 3 together how did that happen well to  understand exactly what happens we need to look at   the execution rule for a while statement so here's  the code that i typed in here's the execution rule   first thing we do when we have a compound while  statement which is this whole last three lines is   to evaluate the headers expression I less than 3  if it's a true value well execute the whole suite   both lines then at the end we return back to step  one which means we evaluate the headers expression   again okay here we have true value which means we  must have a boolean context so George is going to   watch that spot and see if I less than 3 evaluates  to a true value or a false value each time we   reach that line I start at the top as always  after executing that assignment statement we   have a global frame where I on total are both  bound to 0 next we execute the while statement   which means evaluating the headers expression is  bound to 0 which is less than 3 so I less than 3   gives us a true value George is happy and we now  execute the whole suite I is bound to I plus 1 so   now I is bound to the number 1 remember when we  evaluated I plus 1 I was still 0 which is why we   got the number 1 which is what we bound I to and  now we bind total to whatever total is that's 0   and I is that's 1 and total is now 1 according  to the execution rule we now return to step 1   and evaluate the header expression again is I now  less than 3 yes it is George is still happy so we   execute the whole suite is now 2 and the total  is whatever the total is now 1 plus I is 2 is 3   so now total is bound to 3 we return to step 1 and  we see if 2 is less than 3 which it is if George   is happy we then execute the whole suite again and  here's the really important part we first execute   this assignment statement I equals I plus 1 I is  now 3 but we don't go back and check this because   we haven't finished executing the whole suite yet  the next thing we do is execute the next line in   the suite updating total to be total 3 plus I 3  is 6 and then we return to step 1 in step 1 we   evaluate the headers expression and find that 3  is not less than 3 and so this is a false value   and so when we get to step 2 we're not going to  execute the sweet and we're not going to return   to step one we're just finished and that's  why I is bound to three and total is bound   to six after we execute this while statement which  involved repeating the same body many many times
