61a lecture number 19 announcements lab 7 due tuesday homework 4 due thursday and we're releasing a new project the ants project is due next friday but you need to get started by next tuesday to earn the checkpoint and you can earn an early submission bonus point for submitting the whole thing by next thursday there's also an extra credit problem on the project so it's possible to earn even more extra credit there this version of project 3 is shorter than usual this semester is more stressful than usual it's harder to get help there's a lot going on in the world and it's harder to work with your peers now this project started out at a reasonable size and then every semester it seems to have grown a little bit as people think of more questions to ask and what we've done is really just trim it back closer to its original size it's still quite a large program that you have to write larger than any project you've done before now it might be more manageable because your experience has grown throughout the semester but still i encourage you to leave plenty of time for this large project so that you can make sure you get it done by next friday or better yet by next thursday and get that bonus point and what's the project about well it's about ants in particular it's a re-implementation of a game i like called plants vs zombies the version we build in 61a is called ants versus some bees and your job is to build all the logic about how the different characters in the game interact which is a natural application of object-oriented programming and inheritance i'll let you implement the game yourself and then you can play it this thursday we're going to have an advising panel we've been running some one-on-one advising office hours but the same questions sometimes come up again and again so we thought we'd have a larger forum where many people could attend at once you could ask questions about anything you want industry clubs research with your master's program classes whatever and we'll have some members of the course staff on hand to answer your questions so this is just informal peer advising but gives you a chance to understand what's available at berkeley and how to get involved we'll still hold one-on-one advising office hours they are now going to be drop in on fridays from 1 to 2 30 on the office hours queue we've just posted an anonymous survey it's really short it's not required but it would be really nice if you filled it out here's the whole thing and all these questions at the bottom are optional so if you want to give us an indication about how you're feeling about the course whether you're behind in lecture or caught up how you're feeling about assignments and the hint videos as well as giving us some suggestions about how to improve the course i would appreciate it we'll try to implement these suggestions as soon as we can so please complete that survey by monday and finally midterm two is coming up it's two weeks from wednesday so next week you can focus on ants the midterm will be the following week it will have a similar format and style to midterm one although if there were things that you didn't like about midterm one you can tell us about that on this anonymous survey and we might be able to adjust them before midterm two is written this exam will cover content through this week but next week there will not be new content and the week after when you actually take the test there won't be new content either my sense is that some people are a little bit behind in lecture and so i want to give you a chance not just to hear about these topics but solve a homework problem on them or hear about them in lab or discussion or tutorial so that you can really be prepared to do well on the exam so if you look at the upcoming schedule there's the midterm here's where we are these three topics will be on the midterm this topic is going to be completely optional this semester it won't be included in any homeworks or labs or discussions or exams i think it's interesting you'll hear a lot about it in 61b so we're just delaying it until then these two lectures are really about review of everything you've learned about objects and values so i do recommend that you watch those when they come out because they'll help prepare you for the exam and this lecture is optional it's always been optional but it's often students favorite part of the course so i would definitely recommend watching that lecture but you don't need to learn anything from it that will be applied to the midterm on wednesday so that's what's coming up today's lecture about inheritance is about a topic that could be overused so you do need to know about it but i wouldn't recommend using it everywhere that you possibly could but it can be an awfully useful technique when it is applied appropriately
