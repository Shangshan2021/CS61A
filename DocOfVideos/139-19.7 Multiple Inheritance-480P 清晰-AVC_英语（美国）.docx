Multiple inheritance is when a subclass has  multiple base classes. Okay, here we go. Let's   assign another kind of bank account. This is  called the SavingsAccount. It's similar to an   account. The only difference is that there is  a deposit fee. How does that get used? Well,   every time you deposit, it will return  Account.deposit of the amount minus the deposit   fee. So you deposit $10, you really only get  eight more dollars in your bank account. A class   may actually inherit from multiple base classes in  Python. So let's say we have a really smart bank   executive who thinks I've got the perfect idea  for an account. We'll have a nice low interest   rate of 1%. So we don't have to pay our customers  too much money. We'll have $1 fee for withdrawals,   and $2 fee for deposits. But people will come  flocking to us, because we'll give them a free   dollar when they open an account. This is a really  good account. They call it the AsSeenOnTVAccount.   And the way we define this account is actually  quite simple because we already have checking   and savings accounts. So the AsSeenOnTVAccount  inherits from both the CheckingAccount and the   SavingsAccount. When it's created, it takes in  an account holder remembers that account holder,   but instead of setting the balance to 0, you  get a free dollar. And that's actually the whole   implementation. Okay, so a class can inherit  from multiple base classes. What happens when   I create an AsSeenOnTVAccount? Well, I start  out with a balance of 1. That's an instance   attribute. When I look up how to deposit money,  I'm gonna find that deposit method. It's in the   savings account. So that's the savings  account method that when I deposit $20,   I actually only put 18 because of the $2 deposit  fee I had one before, now I have 19 bucks. And   when I withdraw 5, well I pay a checking account  withdrawal fee of $1. Such a deal indeed. Okay,   so it turns out that there are multiple different  withdraws and deposits. But in this case,   it's easy to figure out which one gets looked  at first. So the AsSeenOnTVAccount will get   withdraw from here and deposit from here. And  really, the only thing that it's inheriting   from Account is the interest rate. So, because  this inherits from this inherits from this,   we find the withdrawal method here first. There  is a particular order in which we look at all of   these. And all you need to know is that you look  at the subclass before you look at the base class.
