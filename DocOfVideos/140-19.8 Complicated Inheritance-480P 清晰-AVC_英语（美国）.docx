The last topic of today is just a word of  warning. The multiple inheritance tends to   make programs complicated. So it should be  used very rarely, indeed, if you want to   design clear programs. Well, it's hard for me  to show you why this is the case. So instead,   I'll just show you an analogy about human  inheritance. So let's say you have a grandma,   grandpa, granddaddy, and grandmommy, and they  give you your mom and dad, and then there's   you. This is how we naturally think about family  trees. Okay, so an aunt is a sister of your mom,   so someone else who was a child of grandma and  grandpa. So that's what an aunt is. There's also   something called a half aunt. What's a half  aunt? Well, a half aunt is someone who shares   your grandma but doesn't share your grandpa. So  seems pretty simple so far. If your half aunt   has a kid with some other guy, then you have a  half cousin. But the thing to realize is that   this tree is just growing exponentially at each  layer, which implies that there are many, many   more people in previous generations than there are  now. But that's actually not true. 100 years ago,   there were many fewer people on Earth than there  are now. So it can't be the case that these trees   just grow wider and wider with different sets  of people. There must be some overlapping in   the tree. So there's actually terminology for that  sort of overlap. Let's see what it is. So if your   half aunt was the child of your grandma, and not  just some guy, but instead your granddaddy on your   other side, well that has a name that's called  your double half aunt. And if you're double half   aunt has a kid, that's your double half cousin.  Getting complicated already, due to multiple   inheritance. But it can get worse. If you have a  double half aunt, of course, you're gonna have a   double half uncle on the other side if grandpa and  grandmommy decided to have a kid. And what happens   if that other guy that your double half aunt was  hanging out with is, in fact, your double half   uncle? Then that's not just your double half  cousin. That's your quadruple half cousin, who   shares all four of your grandparents. Moral of the  story, be very careful with multiple inheritance.
