sixty one a lecture number twenty seven announcements so today we're going to start a new unit in the course and learn a new programming language why are we learning a new programming language well you know python already you know about functions and data you know about the object system you even know advanced topics like iterators and generators there's of course more you can learn about the programming language but you don't really need to know anything else in order to build all kinds of things it turns out you don't just know python you also know how programming languages work in general and to demonstrate that i'll show you that we can learn a new programming language together in just one lecture today's lecture on sk so please watch this lecture then try out what you've learned on the lab and the homework that are due wednesday and thursday of this week lab is normally due tuesday but since we have an election in the us i delayed till wednesday and we've tried to make both the lab and the homework fairly short since its election week the only other thing to worry about is that midterm two regrade requests i should say regrade requests are due on monday and if you need to try it out scheme instead of installing something the fastest way is to go to code dot cs sixty and a dot org and load a new scheme interpreter there it is start scheme interpreter and then you can start evaluating scheme expressions like two plus two oh oh well watch on to learn why today's lecture is longer than most in a normal semester some of the examples from today's lecture which is spill over into wednesday's lecture but i think that's worse for you so instead i front loaded the content a little bit put more in this lecture so that you can see the concepts and the examples together and then wednesday's lecture will be short as a result
