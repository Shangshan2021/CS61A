So how am I executing all of this Scheme code  anyway? Did that download something? Well,   you certainly can download an interpreter or  find an online one embedded into a webpage.   We'll give you pointers to both. But in this  case, I haven't been using either of those.
Instead, I've just been using the implementation  from Project 4 of this course. So in Project 4,   you'll build a Python program that implements  a Scheme interpreter. Once you run it,   you're able to evaluate Scheme. And you'll  do that by actually writing the code that   executes the different procedures that  are required in order to execute Scheme   procedures. And this is called an evaluator.  So one of the purposes of learning this new   language is to learn a language that we can  then understand how to build an interpreter for.
