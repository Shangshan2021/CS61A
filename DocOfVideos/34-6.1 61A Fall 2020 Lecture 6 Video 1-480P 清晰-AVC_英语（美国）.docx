61a lecture number six announcements midterm one is on monday if you need to take it at an alternate time because you have a time conflict or this is in the middle of the night please fill out the alternate time request form by this thursday you will record your screen and your head so that we can make sure you're just taking the exam as opposed to collaborating with others you have options for how to do this that were described in this long midterm one email you can use zoom you can use loom or you can use your phone whatever you decide to do please practice making a two-hour video today it doesn't take up two hours to do this you just start the video and do something else like work on your project and at the end of two hours make sure that nothing went wrong with a video then you won't have to worry about it on exam day you can request an exemption from the proctoring policy but you have to do that by this thursday here's a form we will offer a short practice exam on friday and we're going to run it twice from one to two and from seven to eight we'll also just make it available after eight for 48 hours so if you want to take it on saturday or sunday you can and the practice exam is going to use the same software as the real exam so taking it will make sure that you're familiar with everything and i think it's a good idea to record yourself taking this practice exam just to make sure that everything's working the way you'd expect something else to think about this week is that you're welcome to create a one-page two-sided sheet of notes but you do have to create it yourself you can also use scratch paper on the exam since basically everything about the course is available to you you might not need any notes and that's fine but sometimes students like to copy down some instructive examples that they've seen in lecture or lab or discussion or somewhere and just have it handy you're welcome to do that if you want to store your notes electronically that is allowed but only in one way which is to create a google doc that you do not share with anybody else that you create yourself and you must grant edit access to cs618 at berkeley.edu we will not edit it but you're still required to give us access just so we can see what's on that google doc a student group called hkn or ada kappanu has offered to hold a review session which is currently tentatively planned for saturday from 1 pm to 4 pm pacific time they will post details to piazza and i will link those from here whenever that's posted based on your feedback from the week 2 survey i have changed all labs to be due tuesday instead of monday this applies to lab 2 as well which is due this tuesday the hog project is due this week please complete and submit phase one which does not include question six but does include question five buy tuesday and then you receive the checkpoint which is worth one point out of twenty five not a big amount but you should still do it you can get another point by submitting early so try to finish on thursday if it doesn't work out you finish on friday and you don't lose any points you just miss out on one early submission bonus point we'll have a project party from 7 to 9 today and we have lots of office hour appointments available so you can follow the link here or the other way to get there is to go to the office hours page and click on the appointments link either way would get you to the same place we release new appointments at 10 pm every night for the next day and so this afternoon there are many available appointments there are many appointments that have already been filled so i know some people have discovered this already but if you'd like to know exactly when you're going to get to ask your question why not make an appointment and then you don't have to wait around you'll know exactly when it's going to happen you could also join the office hours queue it's not open all the time because we don't have staff to answer questions all the time but you can review the times that it's open by looking at the office hours page which gives you this schedule and you can see that there's office hours most evenings and for a long time on thursday i have also seen lots of people making private piazza posts in fact there are so many that we can't answer them all immediately so expect to wait some time if you make a private post but keep those posts coming we will definitely answer them all finally the hog gui was a broken this is the graphical user interface the part you don't have to write in all previous semesters the rules were such that player 0 and player 1 always alternated turns there were no extra turns that's a new thing this semester and we had to update the gui to handle the fact that sometimes the same player would get two turns in a row now it's fixed if you want to play with the gui you should download the project again you can keep your old work but you do need to copy over the new version of haa guida pai and the gui files directory discussion two and its associated tutorials are this wednesday you really have to go to the orientation before you go to the tutorial or the tutorial is not going to make any sense so please go to the orientation and then go to your tutorial and we also have another exam prep section this friday here are all the zoom links as well as links to the lecture q a for this lecture and friday's lecture there's not really any new content in the course this week because you have plenty to do finishing up your project and getting ready for the midterm but today we'll talk a little bit about how to design a large program and go through an extended example that i think you'll enjoy and friday will mostly be about preparing for the midterm we'll do some review questions together i'll talk about some past questions and how to approach them
