61a lecture number nine announcements the midterm is graded and regrade requests are due on monday you make those in grade scope you are welcome to post questions on piazza but we're not going to fix any problems unless you make a grade scope regrade request as a class i think you did very well on this challenging midterm nice work i am delighted to see how much you've learned now many of you didn't solve all the problems and that's fine the point is to learn this stuff and if you haven't mastered it all yet you still have plenty of opportunity to do so on midterm two and the final exam so keep up the hard work focus on the parts that haven't clicked yet and hang in there i'm also delighted to say that we've been checking our various forms of collaboration detection and so far have detected a very very low rate of collaboration among students as far as i can tell the vast majority of you decided to just take the exam instead of asking somebody else for help and that is the right decision so i'm glad you made it i take no pleasure in catching people who cheated instead i hope to set up our exam so that the obvious and default thing to do is just take the exam according to the rules so that's why we have the rather elaborate amount of cheating detection and the video proctoring and all of that just to make sure that students know taking the exam without collaborating with others is not going to put you at a disadvantage because that's what everybody else is doing too and also the course isn't curved so who cares about other people's scores but the best thing to do for your own score is just take the exam which as far as i can tell is what you did if you're wondering whether you can delete your midterm one recordings from your google drive please keep them there until at least the end of monday while we finish our checks homework 2 will be posted today it's due next thursday there's no exam prep section this week since you just took an exam instead we'll hold and ask us anything session with both your instructors tomorrow 2 10 pm this will not be recorded if you want to hear our answers to anything then you have to come and the only other thing going on is the completely optional hog strategy contest the submission form has been posted in previous announcement videos i said you should try to make sure that your code runs in reasonable time but that's no longer a requirement there's no time limit on your final strategy as long as it finishes submitting before the contest ends then it's fine and if you submit early you can see where you stand relative to everybody else who submitted on the hog strategy contest leaderboard so as i'm making this video there's a submission called blockchain that has won against all 45 opponents followed by the golden ratio followed by somebody who tried to break our web app and failed i am definitely not going to click on that link whatever it is and you can see that other folks have come up with strategies very effective like always role negative one and some strategies are so far not as effective that's fine always roll eight still one eight times and who is the worst of all oh apparently it's stanford well they should really work on that shouldn't they so i encourage you to participate this is completely optional but it could be kind of fun and entries are due next monday today's lecture video is a little bit different in the past most notably because it's not just me professor ferry made some videos and i think they're great the first one which will come next is kind of a review of last lecture but he presents it in a different way and i think it's always good to kind of go over the fundamentals of recursion more than once so take a look at that video and then the rest of the videos of the lecture will be new content and today's content is very important but typically requires some practice to master so that's why we'll have a lab next week and a homework to give you some practice so here we go
