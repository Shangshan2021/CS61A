61a lecture number 11 announcements thanks for recording yourself taking midterm one if you have not yet been contacted about saving your midterm when recording you can delete it if you had trouble making the recording in the first place we do have your notes about that and that's okay there will be no penalty and we will try to improve the process for future exams most people had no problem making a recording but the ones that did found it very frustrating and i'm sorry for that we'll try to figure out how to make it better homework 2 is due on thursday and next week the cats project is due on friday you can get an early submission bonus point for submitting the project on thursday and if you want the checkpoint which is one point to make sure that you're tracking toward the solution at an efficient rate you need to complete the first part of the project by tuesday this project includes course topics including today's lecture as well as everything earlier in the course and what is the cat's project well it's something that tests your typing speed there's a command line interface and a web interface and your code has to compute the accuracy and the speed of whatever is typed so let's try it what a mess look i made mistakes my accuracy was only 87.5 percent wouldn't it be nice if it could correct my mistakes as i type aha will enable autocorrect now as i type if i make a mistake like having then it's going to try to correct it for me it doesn't actually look at what you're trying to type it just looks at what you've typed so far in order to guess about what you should have typed instead undefeated up to that point oh you can see my accuracy is much better now that i have autocorrect on if i type a real word like wit then it's not going to correct that but if i type various non-words then it will try to guess what word i meant to type oh and even corrected that one so that's the cats project hope you enjoy it you'll use some recursion some containers and some data abstraction
